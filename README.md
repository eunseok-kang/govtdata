#My chosen dataset was about school shootings in America in the year of 2018-2019. This dataset proved interesting to me, as back in my neighborhood, my school along with Naperville North, a neighboring school, recieved multiple gun and bombing threats from anonymous individuals. Because of this, I felt a personal connection to this dataset, and thus used it as my dataset of choice. Out of the many columns, I chose to look at the surveyed level of crime near the schools of surveyed and interviewed students. Much of the dataset is "yes or no" based values and questions, so I decided to look at one of the few multiple-answer columns. I was able to find based off the frequency chart that the crime rates near the schools of students generally varied depending on the student. Generally speaking, the crime levels either varied extensively or were at a low level, and it was generally surveyed that students thought that their area had higher levels of crime rather than more moderate levels of crime. This gave extensive insight on how big the gun/shooting problem is within the U.S.
